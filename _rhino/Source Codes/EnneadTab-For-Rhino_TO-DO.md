# *EnneadTab for Rhino* â€” Ideas & To-Do List

note: run fix_to_do.py in IDE to locate files that need attention.

## Blocks
- The following commands path to scripts not located in the "Blocks" folder. Consider consolidating scripts.
  - Display Block Usage *(Display)*
  - Isolate Similar Block *(Selection)*
  - Select Similar Block *(Selection)*
  - Filter Block By Names *(Selection)*
  - Random Block Transform on Srfs *(Create)*
  - Blocks Layout Maker *(Create)*
- Move *"Batch rename blocks"* (alt for *"Display Block Usage"*) to alt for *"Block Name Replace"*
- Split *"Display Block Usage"* into *"Display Block Summary"* and *"Display Block Names"*
- Move *"Select Similar Block"* (alt for *"Isolate Similar Block"*) to alt for *"Filter Block By Names"*
- Combine *"Make Block Unique"* and *"Prefix Blocks w/ Doc"* into one button.

## Layers
- The following commands path to scripts not located in the "Layers" folder. Consider consolidating scripts.
  - Isolate Layer(s) *(Selection)*
  - Isolate Family Layer(s) *(Selection)*
  - Inspect Locked Layer *(Selection)*
  - Display by Layer *(Display)*
- Bug in *"Isolate Nested Layer(s)"*
- Could combined *"Inspect Locked Layer(s)"* and *"Unlock Locked Layer(s)"* into one tool with Eto dialog window

## Revit
- The following commands path to scripts not located in the "Revit" folder. Consider consolidating scripts.
  - Import Revit Export Collection *(Import)*
  - Rhino2Revit Layer Package *(Export)*

## Display
- The following commands path to scripts not located in the "Display" folder. Consider consolidating scripts and/or renaming tab.
  - Sectionbox by BBox *(Views)*
  - Sectionbox by Polysrf *(Views)*
  - Sectionbox Cleanup *(Views)*
  - Visualize Excel Area *(Create)*
  - Open Sample Excel *(Create)*
  - Duplicate Layout *(Layout)*
  - Import Selected Camera *(Import)*
  - Rename Cameras *(Views)*

## Modify
- The following commands path to scripts not located in the "Modify" folder. Consider consolidating scripts and/or renaming tab.
  - Random De-Select *(Selection)*
  - Random De-Select and Group *(Selection)*
  - Random De-Select by Distance *(Selection)*
  - Select in Cluster *(Selection)*
  - Fall Objs On Geo *(Blocks)*
  - Stair Maker *(Create)*
  - Section Crowd *(Create)*
- *Random De-Select by Distance* creates pipe polysrf to demonstrate near/far clamp dist. Possible better way to illustrate without creating geo?
- *Select in Cluster* creates spheres to demonstrate falloff. Better way to illustrate?
- Create alt command for *Select in Cluster and Group*.
- Add feature to *Punch Glass In* to auto-trim a co-planar wall surface.


## Resource
- There is no "Resource" folder. Consider creating one and relocating scripts there for clarity in the file structure.
- *SaveSmallAndClose* is very destructive; consider adding dialog window to control purge
