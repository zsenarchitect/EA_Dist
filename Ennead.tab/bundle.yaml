# for future. Can consider control basic and beta tier by changing layout yaml file
# after publish to L drive in basic tier. When find #beta in line, comment out the
# line to disbale that tool. This can be either in panels or button organization.

# Eventually do not need Ennead+. Don't know how good this idea is for long term
# manage because it is largely invisible for me, and basic tier can be too much again.
